# Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) Course

## Course Introduction

As part of the African Masterâ€™s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI 2021), we have delivered a course on Geometric Deep Learing (GDL100), which closely follows the contents of our GDL proto-book. We make all materials and artefacts from this course publicly available, as companion material for our proto-book, as well as a way to dive deeper into some of the contents for future iterations of the book.
